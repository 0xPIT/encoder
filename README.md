RotaryEncoder with Button
=============

**See Arduino Library in the [Branch arduino]**

Atmel AVR C++ RotaryEncoder with Button Implementation.

- Timer-Based: Works on any IO-Pin.
- Supports rotary acceleration, so when the encoder is rotated faster, the encoders value will increment faster
- Button reports multiple states: `Clicked`, `DoubleClicked`, `Held` and `Released`
